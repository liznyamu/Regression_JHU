- Outliers can be the result of spurious or real processes
- Outlier can have high leverage (ie located/values extremely higher or lower) WITH/WITHOUT influence ( without influence ie they conform to the regression relationship - being marginally outlying in X or Y, but not outlying given the regression relationship)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Influence Measures/ Useful diagnostic Measures (?influence.measures)
--> rstandard, rstudent
- variations of residuals (- residuals have the same units as y) without units (allowing comparison of residuals) ie they standardize residuals by dividing by appropiate standard error

--> hatvalues
- leverage - depicts how far outlying the outlier is from other X's; the further it is the more leverage it has
- hatvalues (more useful when we can't visualize outliers in models with multiple X values/columns/regressors)
- hatvalues useful in finding data entry errors (ie extremely large hatvalues -- could imply data entry error)

--> dffits , dfbetas
- measuring influence (not just the potential for influence like hatValues/leverages)
- dffits - for every data point, sees how much the fitted value at that X-value changes depending on whether or not that point was included
- dfbetas - looks specifically at the slope co-efficients -> how much do the slope co-efficients change; whether or not that particular data point is included

ie for dffits - we get one dffit per data point 
   for dfbetas - we get a dfbeta for every co-efficient for every data point
   ie 
   so if we have a linear regression model - we have 2 co-efficients : the intercept and the slope term ; so  dfbetas will be a matrix of 2 by the number of datapoints
   
   
--> cooks.distance
- cooks.distance is an overall change in our co-efficients 
- it summarizes the dfbetas

--> resid
- function resid returns the ordinary residuals 
- PRESS residuals = resid(fit) / (1 - hatvalues(fit))

--> PRESS redisiduals
- they are less useful for detecting outliers and determining influenc ; then they are ascertaining things like module fit

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> Plot the residuals versus the fitted values
- search for systematic pattern in your residual plot - that's evidence of some kind of lack of fit 

--> Residual QQ plot 
- that tries to ascertain normality

--> The plot of the leverage values 
- that tries to acertain that there any points that have high leverage
- you would want to go and look at those row of data specifically -- maybe there were data entry errors
